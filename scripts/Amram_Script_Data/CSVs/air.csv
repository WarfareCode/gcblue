Going to assume RCS of roughly 1mÃ‚Â², will work with 1.1, yielding a dB of 0.414, tack on the -10dB reduction from Spectra and its -9.586dB, or 0.11mÃ‚Â² effective.  Given this RCS it can get within 108km of an E-2C 2000 NP undetected.  It can also get within 53km of an F/A-18E/F while detecting the super hornet at 104.8km.  Primarily armed with Magic missiles, while not overly capable, they are sufficient in most cases given its discreet nature.  Couple this with some support for AIM-120's, and you have the makings of a very mean, reasonably priced naval dominance fighter.http://rafalenews.blogspot.com/p/rafale-weapon-load-out.html","2006","2999","France","Fighter Multi","1287","20","18","4577","4.328","1","AirDmg1","-9.5861","AirRCS1","8.21","-5","IR_FW_S_F_HP_1_M0.85","IR_FW_S_F_HP_1_AB_M0.85","IR_FW_S_F_HP_2_Super_M2","0","-999","Default","Default","Default","24500","16800","255","9","450","1","0","0","30","3600","10800","100080","0.0001","151240","0.00067","13.77","0.847","1.078","0.9","0.8","1.2","100","50","1","1","1","0.8","0.635","0.45","0.15","0.02","0.005","0.00125","1","1","1","0.9861","1.06","1.2326","1.8488","2.4651","4.9302","4.9302"

The official designation was Tu-128, but this designation was less commonly used in the West. It was the largest and heaviest fighter ever in service.  In 1950s Soviet Union sought the means to defend against the nuclear-armed American bombers possibly penetrating its borders (especially its long and vulnerable northern border). Contemporary interceptors, even the Yakovlev Yak-28P, were able to cover a radius of a few hundred kilometers; the newly-developed surface-to-air missiles had even shorter range. Considering both, the sheer numbers required to defend a 5,000 km air front were economically impossible to maintain. This left Soviet Union able to provide a modern air defense only for selected valuable areas. The PVO decided to cover entire territory, but with a more loose defense. In 1955 it placed a requirement for a large area-defense interceptor, that would achieve it with sparse airbases. The PVO requirement called for a supersonic aircraft with enormous fuel tanks for both a good patrol time and a long range, a capable radar, and the most powerful air-to-air missiles possible.","","1964","1979","Russia","Fighter","1200","12.89","8","14854","3.99996","1","AirDmg1","11.3","AirRCS1","6.97","0","IR_FW_VL_F_HP_2_M0.85","IR_FW_VL_F_HP_1_M0.85","IR_FW_VL_F_HP_1_Super_M1.7","0","-999","Default","Default","Default","43013","15600","40","2.5","1350","0","0","0","20","3600","10800","150000","0.0008","215800","0.0019","12.60772","2.16","2.7","1.8","0.9","1.2","110","60","0.94","0.83","0.7","0.59","0.48","0.37","0.2","0.07","0.01","0.01","1","1","1","1.05","1.11","1.3","2","4","10","999"
