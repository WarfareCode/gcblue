Thats puts Searchwater's ref range at 46.675km.  It(searchwater) also quotes a range of 28+nm for a snorkel and this ref range approximates this as well putting range to a  1m² target at 25.2nm.  Will use a vaule less than this for the Sea spray, again as it isn't intended for EW purposes and more for target acquisition.","185.2","10.367","360","-60","10","2","GenericSensor","0.01","0.17","0.21","3000000000","3500000000","99","1","1","54.75","44.75","4","0","2.5","-3","-12","3000000","5","3.3","-30","1","0","0","1"

Since a rough means to estimate fighter performance is power times aperture, and power is unchanged, then this radar should detect a 3m² target at the same range that KLJ-7 detects a 3m² target, or 89.443km.

Since the Chinese selected it for the J-17, and the Chinese PL-13 has a maximum engagement range of 148km, I will assume this radar has an instrumented range of either 90NM(167km), or its detection range of a 15dBsm target +10%, which ever is larger.
