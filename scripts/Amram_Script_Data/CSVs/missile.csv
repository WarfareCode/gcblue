"Sea Dart Mod0","","5","64","100000","544","3","1900","2999","","","","mis/icoSEA DART M1.jpg","seadart.xml","Sea Dart Mod0 SAM  550kt target engaged at 83.4km","this missile is setup as an odd case considering how most other weapons have been spec'd, and may trigger a review of the other ramjet powered weapons.  I had originally setup the weapons much as i would have done firing in initial numbers that should approximate the desired performance, and then doubled the run of the sustainer, tweaked thrust and drag to remain within speed bounds, and achieve the desired range, and then called her ready.  Further reading has suggested the quoted ranges for the Sea Dart do not include her ballistic end phase, because the missile is hardly effective once without power due to its unfavorable aerodynamics, bleeding off speed at a very rapid pace compared to rocket powered missiles.  The quoted range is often 25-30nm, as such I have assumed powered flight to 25nm.  The result is a kinetic range of 59.1km and an engagement range of 83.4km against 550kt closing targets.  The missile sustains a very high average speed, due entirely to the sustainer keeping its speed high for nearly all of its flight.  In close it is inferior to SM1/SM2, the standard series achieving a far higher peak speed and thus close in reaction time.  For ranges approaching 64km the playing field is much more level if not in favour of the Sea Dart.  For engagement ranges in excess of 64km the tables again turn as this is the furthest range to engage a 550kt target at 10km alt and still be powered for the duration, any further and the intercept itself is unpowered, speed is very rapidly bled, and the better missile rapidly becomes the SM2.  As a starting point I took the originally assigned drag and quadrupled it, then weakened the booster to just reach mach two under any conditions(thrust down from 130kN to 122kN, same duration), then improved the sustainer from 23kN for 11 seconds to 32kN for 58 seconds, and reduced the minspeed from 500m/s to 400m/s.","4","BlastFragAir24kg","0","10","0","34567","2","59.1","0.85","","","0","0","9.68744215","-4.7","MissileRCS1","2","0","IR_M_S_R_M0.85","Default","IR_M_S_R_Super_M2.7","0","0","15","54.6","0.02","0.09","0.06","0.8","1.2","122000","3.5","32000","58","400","Sea Dart Seeker","1","0","0","10000","2","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TestMissileDmg"
"Sea Dart Mod2","","5","64","100000","544","3","1990","2999","","","","mis/icoSEA DART M2.jpg","seadart.xml","Sea Dart Mod2 SAM  550kt target engaged at 136.2km","Mod2 has guidance updates that permit the missile to achieve far better range than previously managed.  The missile itself is otherwise unchanged.  the maximum effective range is expected to increase to nearly double as a result.  I set a guidance mode than put the missile up to a cruising alt chosen to reach the desired range increase.  I have found it necessary to rework the sustainer however, as the missile was achieving speeds FAR too high at higher altitudes.  the impulse of the sustainer is unchanged.  it was 32knx58s=1856kNs.  Thrust has been reduced, and duration increased accordingly to maintain this impulse value.  Doing so necessitated an alteration of the booster as well to prevent an odd seeming loss of speed when the stages changed.  Booster cutout occurs at 665m/s, mach 2.013 @ 2470m, continuing the climb speed bleeds down to 631.1m/s or mach 1.963(each occurs at a different altitude).  minimum missile speed prior to burnout is 573.2m/s, mach 1.68, over a 20km intercept.  Powered flight ends at 79.8km from launch point, Mod0 currently expires at 46.3km, this puts the range improvement at 172.4% greater powered range.  kinematic range is 99km, mod 0 kinematic range is 59.1km, an improvement of 167.5%.  Missile speed is a peak of 1040.3m/s(mach 3) at burnout, this compares to 913.083m/s(mach 2.68).  Average speed throughout the flight is 756.6m/s compared to 697.6m/s.  intercept occurs in 132 seconds compared to 86 seconds.  Average speed at 86 seconds is 851.9m/s.  The missile engages a target at 83.4km(the limit for the mod0) in 80 seconds with an average speed of 774.5m/s, the intercept occuring 7.5% sooner.  The range itself comes to equal to the RIM-66H(100km) at 99km.  Compared to RIM-66H, peak speed is approximately equal, close in reaction is considerably weaker however at range the Sea Dart is definitely the superior weapon.  Effective range of the RIM-66 is larger, only because its average speed is lower, allowing the target to cover more ground before the intercept occurs.  At ranges of less than 48km RIM-66 achieves intercept in less time than Sea Dart.  At 24km RIM-66 is 8.25 seconds faster, at 18km it is 8.76 seconds faster.  At any range over 48km Sea dart arrives first, at 50km it is  1.65 seconds faster, by 75 km it is 21.9 seconds faster, and by maximum range of 99km it is 36.54 seconds faster than RIM-66H.  This disparity in performance will be studied further at a later date.  I may be back to this, and the Sea dart might well be in for a significant reworking of its performance.","4","BlastFragMis24kg","0","10","0","34567","2","99","0.85","","","0","0","6.850056037","-4.7","MissileRCS1","2","0","IR_M_S_R_M0.85","Default","IR_M_S_R_Super_M3.2","0","0","15","54.6","0.072","0.09","0.06","0.8","1.2","61500","8","22000","84.3","400","Sea Dart Mod3 Seeker","1","0","20","11500","0","0","0.01","0","2","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TestMissileDmg"
