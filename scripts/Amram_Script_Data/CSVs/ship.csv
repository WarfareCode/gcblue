She is one of the largest warships in the world. She was laid down, launched and commissioned as CVAN-68, but was redesignated CVN 68 (nuclear-powered multimission aircraft carrier) on 30 June 1975 as part of the fleet realignment of that year.  The ship was named for World War II Pacific fleet commander Chester W. Nimitz, who was the NavyÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last fleet admiral. Unlike all subsequent Nimitz class carriers, Nimitz only uses her namesake's surname. She is also the only carrier of her class and the most recent supercarrier not to be named for someone who held elective office in the United States.  Nimitz was homeported at Naval Station Norfolk until 1987, when she was relocated to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. After her mid-life overhaul and nuclear reactor refueling in 2001, Nimitz was relocated to NAS North Island, in San Diego, California.  Nimitz home port was changed from the NAS North Island, to Everett, Washington. This move is expected to save the Navy $100 million a year.","","33","0.1","8.43","12808180","0","1000","Ship100000Dmg","11.3","Nimitz Flight Deck","63.966","ShipRCS1","38.893","15.501","ShipIR1","Default","Default","30","20","Default","S12.Carrier Large","Default"

She is one of the largest warships in the world. She was laid down, launched and commissioned as CVAN-68, but was redesignated CVN 68 (nuclear-powered multimission aircraft carrier) on 30 June 1975 as part of the fleet realignment of that year.  The ship was named for World War II Pacific fleet commander Chester W. Nimitz, who was the NavyÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last fleet admiral. Unlike all subsequent Nimitz class carriers, Nimitz only uses her namesake's surname. She is also the only carrier of her class and the most recent supercarrier not to be named for someone who held elective office in the United States.  Nimitz was homeported at Naval Station Norfolk until 1987, when she was relocated to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. After her mid-life overhaul and nuclear reactor refueling in 2001, Nimitz was relocated to NAS North Island, in San Diego, California.  Nimitz home port was changed from the NAS North Island, to Everett, Washington.

The first ship, the Wismar (now the Indonesian Sutanto), was launched on 9 April 1981 in Rostock, and subsequently another 15 ships were built until 1986. To make production more economical, the Soviet Union agreed to purchase another 12 ships from Wolgaster Peenewerft, which were built between 1986 and 1990, thereby effectively subsidising the East German shipbuilding industry.The ships of the Red Navy were named Parchim II by NATO. Though useful as a coastal ASW platform, the Soviet production of the very likewise but far more powerful Grisha class made this purchase even more illogical for the Red Navy. After German re-unification the former East German ships were sold to the Indonesian Navy in 1993. The Indonesian Navy extensively refurbished the Parchims sold to them to the point where the cost of refurbishing exceeded the cost of purchasing them. They are still in service, both in the Indonesian Navy and in the Russian Baltic Fleet.","","26","0.21","11.56","134400","0.179198452","74","Ship1000Dmg","10","","34.28","ShipRCS1","30.377","17.718","ShipIR1","Default","Default","3.5","20","Default","S02.Frigate","Default"

First laid down in 1970 the Kiev class was partially based on a design for a full-deck carrier proposed in Project Orel. Originally the Soviet Navy wanted a supercarrier similar to the American Kitty Hawk class. However, the smaller Kiev class design was chosen because it was considered to be more cost effective.  Unlike American or British carriers, the Kiev class is a combination of a cruiser and a carrier. In the Soviet Navy this class of ships was specifically designated as a heavy aviation cruiser rather than just an aircraft carrier. Although the ships were designed with an island superstructure to starboard, with a 2/3 length angled flight deck, the foredeck was taken up with the heavy missile armament. The intended mission of the Kiev class was support for strategic missile submarines, other surface ships and naval aviation, it was capable of engaging in anti-aircraft, anti-submarine and surface warfare.  A total of four Kiev class carriers were built and commissioned, serving in the Soviet and then Russian Navy. The first three were decommissioned, of which, one was scrapped and two were sold as recreational pieces to China.

Originally built for the Soviet Navy, in Russia they are usually known by the designation Project 1144 Orlan (sea eagle).  They are second in size only to aircraft carriers, and are similar in size to a World War I battleship. Because of this, the ships are sometimes known as battlecruisers in the West. It is more appropriate to consider Kirov an oversized guided missile cruiser, analogous to the U.S. Navy Alaska-class large cruiser, which had the displacement and armament of a battlecruiser but otherwise was closer to a heavy cruiser in mission and construction. Soviet and Russian naval analysts always referred to it as a TARKR (literal translation from Russian - Heavy Nuclear(-Powered) Missile Cruiser). The appearance of the Kirov class played a large role in the recommissioning of the Iowa-class battleships by the United States Navy in the 1980s.  The Kirov hull design also was used for the nuclear-powered SSV-33 command ship.  The Kirov class's main weapons are 20 ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ P-700 Granit (SS-N-19) Shipwreck missiles mounted in deck, designed to engage large surface targets, and air defense is provided by 12 ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 8 S-300F launchers with 96 missiles and 2 ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 20 Osa-MA with 40 missiles. The ships had some differences in sensor and weapons suites; the lead ship Kirov came with SS-N-14 ASW missiles; on subsequent ships these were replaced with 9K331 Tor SAM systems. The 9K331 Tor installation is in fact mounted further forward of the old SS-N-14 mounting, in the structure directly behind the blast shield for the bow mounted RBU ASW rocket launcher. Kirov and Frunze had eight 30 mm AK-630 close-in weapon systems, which were supplanted with the Kashtan (CADS-N-1) air-defence missile/gun system on later ships.  Other weapons are the automatic 130 mm AK-130 gun system (except on Kirov which had two single 100 mm guns instead), 10 ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ torpedo/missile tubes (capable of firing SS-N-15 missiles on later ships), Udav-1 with 40 anti-submarine rockets and the 2 ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ RBU-1000 six-tube launchers.","","30","0.12","9","3402000","0.674994168","1866","Ship20000Dmg","9.1","Triple Helo Hangar","55.33","ShipRCS1","36.23","22.17","ShipIR1","Default","Default","13","20","Default","S09.Battle Cruiser","Default"

The name comes from the Stocznia PÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½lnocna shipyard (Northern Shipyard) at Gdansk, where they were built. 107 were built by 1986 (last 16 by Stocznia Marynarki Wojennej (Naval Shipyard) at Gdynia, Poland). In 2002, one ship of a modernised design NS-722 was built in Gdynia for Yemen.  The Polnocny class ships are classified as medium landing ships in the Russian Navy, and are loosely equivalent to Western tank landing ships. They are equipped with a bow ramp that allows beach landings. The Polnocny-C version can carry 8 armored personnel carriers, or 250 tons of stores. Unlike their Western counterparts, these ships can provide substantial fire support for landed troops with their embarked multiple rocket launchers.
